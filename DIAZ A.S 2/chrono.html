            <h1>Five Night's at Freddy's 4 (2015)</h1>
            <p>Unlike most of the games in the FNAF franchise, in this game we play a child instead of a security guard. In the entire game we, the player, are only armed with a flashlight as we sit alone in our bedroom while constantly being haunted by the nightmare versions of the animatronics: Freddy, Chica, Foxy and Bonnie. This game is the first to take place chronologically since it is set in 1983, we soon discover that the child we play as is actually the victim of the "Bite of '83" through minigames, we see that a child is being bullied by a couple of boys wearing masks and dies when the bullies carry the child and places their head inside the mouth of Fredbar a Fredbear's Family Diner.</p>

            <h1>Five Nights At Freddy's: Sister Location (2016)</h1>
            <p>We aren't fully sure when do the events of this game take place but most fans agree that it comes after FNAF 4 and before FNAF 2, In this game we are introduced to the lore of the creator of the animatronics, William Afton along with his children. In the game, participants take on the role of Michael Afton, who ends up at Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental, an underground warehouse that rents out animatronics for events. The animatronics, such as Circus Baby and Ballora, are exclusive to this game, and the robots originate from a sister restaurant of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza that has since closed. In "Funtime" versions with a circus theme, other Fazbear animatronics such as Bonnie, Freddy, and Foxie also make an appearance. Through Sister Location, Circus Baby gains Michael's trust and ultimately lures him to his demise, enabling the animatronic Ennard's endoskeleton to use Michael's flesh as a cover to escape the property.</p>

            <h1>Five Nights At Freddy's 2 (2014)</h1>
            <p>In the FNAF timeline, the FNAF 2 game takes third place chronologically as it is set in 1987. The players will play as Jeremy Fitzgerald, this game is similar to most of the FNAF games as we are once again a night shift security guard. Every night, Jeremy gets a call from an anonymous employee who gives him details about the job and the location. The animatronics are free to move about the building and are designed to seek out sound, even at night, as players discover. It is also disclosed that the building houses old animatronics in storage for the purpose of providing spare parts. After a while, Jeremy finds out that the restaurant is the subject of a police investigation, akin to the "Bite of '87" that was alluded to in the first game. In addition to "The Purple Man," who many fans believe killed multiple kids at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, FNAF2 featured post-death Atar-style minigames.</p>

            <h1>Five Nights At Freddy's (2014)</h1>
            <p>The first FNAF game is believed by fans to be set around 1993 which is why it takes fourth place chronologically. In this game we play as Mike Schmidt (not to be confused with Michael Afton as a lot of people who watched the movie thought that Mike and Michael were the same person). The unidentified recorded voice informs players that the animatronics have a habit of mistaking humans for endoskeletons, which causes them to "forcefully stuff" people inside of animatronic suits. The game takes place in a different location than that of FNAF2. Newspaper clippings and some stories told over the phone are the primary sources of the series lore featured in the 2014 original game. The player discovers that a man is using an animatronic suit as cover to trick five kids into killing them. Fans theorized that the children's corpses might have been concealed inside the animatronics after guests later complained that the machines smelled bad and leaked strange fluids.

            <h1>Five Nights At Freddy's 3 (2015)</h1>
            <p>The third FNAF game is quite different from the previous games. It is set about 30 years after the events of the original FNAF (around 2023), We play as a night shift guard once again in a place called "Fazbear's Frights". Eventually, the group of murdered children appears to be exacting revenge on their killer by cornering him and making him hide in an animatronic where he is crushed and killed. This game also uses post-death minigames. The only physical animatronic in FNAF3 is called Springtrap, and he is thought to be possessed by the late William Afton. There are also a few ghosts of earlier animatronics that are unable to hurt the player physically.

            <h1>Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator (2017)</h1>
            <p>In this game the players are now the owners of the Fazbear Entertainment Restaurant. The voice on the cassette recordings after the final night reveals that this place was made in an effort to entice the remaining Fazbear animatronics into a central area so that they could all be destroyed. The video of the pizzeria burning down with the animatronics trapped inside is shown in a cutscene that the game plays before cutting to the building and its contents being consumed by fire.

            <h1>Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach (2021)</h1>
            <p>Fans suspect that this game takes place somewhere around 2024 - 2029, it is unclear when does it actually take place but one thing we are sure about is that it is confirmed that FNAF: Pizzeria Simulator happens before this game. In the game, players take on the role of Gregory, a young child who escaped from Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex after it closed and is now being pursued by roving animatronics. One of Security Breach's multiple endings has players discovering the burned-out remains of Pizzeria Simulator, thereby establishing the chronology of events connecting the two games.
